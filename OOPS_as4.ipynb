To access or modify private data, Python uses getter and setter methods, which provide controlled access. This helps maintain data security, integrity, and prevents unintended modifications."

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages that make software development more organized, maintainable, and scalable. Here are the key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 1. Modularity\n",
        "Code is organized into classes and objects, which makes it easier to manage and understand. Each class handles its own behavior and data, leading to a modular structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 2. Reusability\n",
        "Through inheritance, you can reuse existing code in new classes, reducing redundancy and development time.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 3. Encapsulation\n",
        "OOP allows data to be hidden inside objects and accessed only through methods. This protects the internal state and prevents unintended interference, improving security and data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 4. Abstraction\n",
        "You can hide complex details and expose only the necessary parts of an object. This makes the system easier to use and reduces complexity for the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 5. Polymorphism\n",
        "With polymorphism, you can use the same interface for different underlying data types or classes. This leads to flexible and extensible code that can work with objects of different classes through a common interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 6. Scalability and Maintainability\n",
        "OOP makes it easier to update and expand a system. Since classes are self-contained, changes in one class usually don’t affect others, making maintenance safer and more efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ 7. Improved Collaboration\n",
        "In team environments, OOP helps developers work independently on different classes or modules without interfering with each other, promoting parallel development."

The purpose of __str__ is to return a string that is readable and meaningful for end users. For example, if you have a Book class and define __str__ to return \"Book Title: Python Basics\", then printing the object will display this clean message. This is especially useful when you want to display information in a presentable format without showing internal details.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the __repr__ method is intended for developers and debugging. It returns an unambiguous string that ideally looks like valid Python code that could recreate the object. When you type the object directly into the Python shell or call repr(obj), this method is used. If __str__ is not defined in a class, Python automatically falls back to __repr__. Together, these methods allow you to control how your objects are represented both during development and in user-facing output, improving clarity, readability, and debuggability of your code."
